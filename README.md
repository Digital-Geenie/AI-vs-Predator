# AI-vs-Predator
Problem statement -

1. Schools have become hunting grounds for sexual predators

2. Children are easiest targets for sexual predators

3. Cameras in school premises are not omnipresent and don't act as a       deterrent for predators.

4. Existing solutions are reactive and not preventive.



Solution :

1. Detect sexual predators among school staff at an early stage, thus creating a preventive solution.

2. Based on research sexual predators have unique body language and facial expressions that distinguish them from people with a healthy mind.

3. Psychiatrists can detect predatory nature in people on observing them.

In India, there is a dearth of psychiatrists with only 1 per 1 lakh.

4. AI can be used to analyze video streams of classrooms to detect sexual predators.

5. School staff breaching threshold will be then sent to a psychiatrist for validation and if confirmed by the psychiatrist, they will be asked to step down and seek medical help.

This use case seems to be the need of hour amid rising cases of sexual assault on children in school. It can be further extended to other public places prone to attacks.



This will be a public project for us and by us. If the use case seems relevant let us collaborate and contribute big and small in whichever way we can. Tag your friends in software, medical, government organization and let us see if we can create a workable and feasible solution.
